## Tomb-scripts

A collection of scripts to use with Tomb@.
To make life easier :)


post-hooks
---------
This is a simple post-hook script that executes on tomb 'close' action.
It is made to deal with 'sandfox' and its chroot environments.

If you use sandfox, with this script you can type a tomb close and your sandfox will be closed too, avoiding manual sandfox close action.
